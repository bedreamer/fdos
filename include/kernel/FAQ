  about file struct and inode struct. 

.NOTE
  In Unix all devices ara treated as file, such as a hard disk device will
be mapped into a file /dev/hd, disk partition will be mapped also. 
  what I want to say was every device in system is a file. 

***
  inode struct

  inode struct could be a normal file, directory, device, pipe or fifo 
etc.

  inode struct will alloced in thess case as fllow:
  *  a directory be opend.
  *  a normal file be opend.
  *  a device node be added into system.

***
  file struct

  file struct will be treated as an opened file in kernel.

  file struct will be alloced if user call the open syscall methord.
